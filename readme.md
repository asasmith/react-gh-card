# Github Social Card

Displays a github 'social card' with some basic github user data

Using this app to teach myself basic [React](https://reactjs.org) concepts like function and class components, JSX, rendering, managing state, props, handling events, conditional rendering, and controlled form elements. I used [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for module bundling but plan on switching to [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)I also used the fetch api. 

### Next steps

- [ ] add testing
- [ ] add eslint/prettier
- [ ] change module bundler to webpack
